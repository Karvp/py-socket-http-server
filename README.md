# Python HTTP socket server
A Python http server handled by Python's socket library

# Introduction
This is a simple HTTP server that makes use of the socket library in Python. Throughout, I have learned there are many better libraries in this field, but this project blended my interests in networking, so I continued building it. Anyway, I am too lazy to read those hundred pages of documentation :v, so I just prefer sitting here and waiting for professors like you :>.

That being said, every contribution is greatly appreciated! I do not care about anything except the reliability of your code, so... thanks!
